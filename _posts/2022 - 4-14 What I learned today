title: Things I learned from Photogram
---
1. I learned that scaffold is good shortcut in developing the RCAV scripts.
2. I also learned that devise can automatically set the security for users. 
3.  I can set a default value to a column using this link: https://blog.arkency.com/how-to-add-a-default-value-to-an-existing-column-in-a-rails-migration/
4.  Active Record automatically created statuses if you put the enum column. (.statuses.keys)
5.  You can only destroy the parent object after destroying the children object. Otherwise, need to add dependent: :destroy.
