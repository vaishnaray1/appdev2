title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):
 1. I can use the shovel operation in addition to the + for appending. 
 2. If they are two variables with the same symbol, then they have the same object ID. 
 3. Two symbols cannot be concatenated together.

1. I learned that scaffold is good shortcut in developing the RCAV scripts.
2. I also learned that devise can automatically set the security for users. 
3.  I can set a default value to a column using this link: https://blog.arkency.com/how-to-add-a-default-value-to-an-existing-column-in-a-rails-migration/
4.  Active Record automatically created statuses if you put the enum column. (.statuses.keys)
5.  You can only destroy the parent object after destroying the children object. Otherwise, need to add dependent: :destroy.
