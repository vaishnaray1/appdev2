title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):
 1. I can use the shovel operation in addition to the + for appending. 
 2. If they are two variables with the same symbol, then they have the same object ID. 
 3. Two symbols cannot be concatenated together.
